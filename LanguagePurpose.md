# Language Purpose
* Swift <br>
Swift was created to replace Objective-C. Swift solves problems that Objective-C has. For example, Objective-C can be very hard to read because it uses tons of brackets. Objective-C also had issues because it was basically C welded with object functionality. Swift made it easier for developers to create programs for apple devices because it is easier to read and handles memory management using ARC.
* Java <br>
Java was created to replace C/C++ with a better design, to enable creation of applets on the internet, and to be portable on work on all sorts of enviorments. A big problem Java solved was the ability to "Write Once, Run Anywhere", meaning that you could write code and run it on pretty much any device.
