# Procedural & Functional programming

* Swift
  * Swift can technically be used for procedural programming, although if you were using it for any real world use it would become almost useless as apple devices are action driven. 
  * Swift can certainly be used as a functional programming and its use of delegates is very helpful in doing so. 
* Java
  * Java can be used for procedural programming, it isnt set up to by default but you could easily just set up a bunch of steps to take in a row and it would do so, and Java being used for a wide range of uses there are times this could be desireable.
  * With the addition of lambdas in Java it has opened the door to lead to some functional programming.
