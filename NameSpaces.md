# Name Space

* Swift <br>
Swift name spaces are not per-file, they are per target. Chirs Lattner says "Namespacing is implicit in Swift, all classes (etc) are implicitly scoped by the module (XCode target) they are in. No class prefixes needed".

* Java <br>
In Java a package is a named collection of classes (and possibly subpackages). Packages serve to group related classes and define a namespace for the classes they contain. To create a new name space you can create a new package by simply right clicking and creating a new one. To use a name space we import it. ```import java.io.File;``` Name spaces are generally used to keep similar groups of code together.
